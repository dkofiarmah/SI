Component Breakdown
1. Data Ingestion Layer
Tools: Scrapy, Playwright, ScrapegraphAI
Responsibilities:
Batch and edge scraping of government websites, media outlets, social media.
Schedule jobs using Apache Airflow (or cron-based scheduling for MVP).
2. Data Cleaning & Enrichment
Process:
Deduplication, normalization (using Pandas/Python).
Entity resolution via rule-based + ML-based matching.
News summarization and entity extraction using Deepseek-Lite, spaCy, and LangChain.
Output: Cleaned and enriched data ready for storage and graph mapping.
3. Storage & Database Layer
Graph Database:
Neo4j: Stores entity-centric knowledge graph (relationships between Person, Organization, Place, Event, Country).
Relational Database:
Supabase (PostgreSQL): Stores raw data, metadata, and user authentication details.
Search Engine:
Elasticsearch: Provides full-text search, geospatial queries, and fast retrieval of news articles and entity records.
4. AI/LLM & Analytics Services
Components:
LLM/NLP: Deepseek-Lite (self-hosted), spaCy for NLP tasks.
Analytics Pipeline: Combines rule-based trend detection, ARIMA models, and LLM inference for forecasting.
News Summarization: Automated pipeline to process, summarize, and categorize news articles by location, category, and related entities.
5. API Layer
Framework: FastAPI (Python)
Responsibilities:
Expose RESTful/GraphQL endpoints for frontend access.
Secure endpoints with OAuth2.
Aggregate data from Neo4j, Supabase, and Elasticsearch.
Serve real-time news summaries and entity queries.
6. Frontend
Framework: React.js
Visualization:
Graph Visualization: D3.js and/or Tremor for dynamic network graphs.
Geospatial Maps: Mapbox integration.
Dashboard Components: Curated news feeds, trend charts, and entity detail panels.
User Interaction: Search, drill-down on entities, and view curated intelligence digests.
7. Deployment & Infrastructure
Containerization & Orchestration:

Not required for MVP.
Use lightweight deployment methods without Docker or Kubernetes.
Cloud Platform & Hosting:

Frontend:
Host the React.js application on Vercel or Netlify for fast, cost-effective static site hosting with built-in CDN and auto-deployment from GitHub.
Backend & API:
Deploy the FastAPI endpoints as serverless functions using Vercel or Netlify Functions (or use a minimal VM instance on a low-cost provider if needed).
Alternatively, use GitHub Pages in conjunction with serverless backends (e.g., AWS Lambda via a lightweight framework) for MVP-level requirements.
CI/CD:

Use GitHub Actions (or GitLab CI) to automate testing and deployment.
Configure the CI/CD pipelines to automatically deploy frontend updates to Vercel/Netlify and backend/serverless function updates as needed.
Monitoring & Logging:

Leverage built-in monitoring and logging provided by Vercel/Netlify for frontend deployments.
For backend functions, use lightweight logging services (e.g., Loggly, Papertrail, or cloud provider logging) to capture errors and performance metrics.
For application performance monitoring, consider integrating a lightweight service like Sentry for error tracking and performance insights.

Implementation Roadmap
Phase 1 (Months 1-2): Data Foundation & Prototyping
Set up cloud infrastructure, deploy Docker containers.
Build and deploy scrapers for 10+ Ghanaian sources.
Develop initial data cleaning and enrichment pipeline.
Construct a basic Neo4j graph and Supabase database.
Build a prototype React dashboard showcasing a network graph (e.g., Ghanaian MPs and affiliations).
Phase 2 (Months 3-4): Analytics & News Engine
Integrate LLM services (Deepseek-Lite) for entity enrichment and news summarization.
Develop AI pipelines for generating curated news summaries and extracting key insights.
Enhance the API layer with endpoints for entity search and news feeds.
Pilot daily intelligence digests with early partners.
Phase 3 (Months 5-6): Beta Testing & MVP Launch
Onboard beta users (security agencies, journalists, government bodies) for UI/UX feedback.
Optimize performance (ensure < 5s query responses).
Fine-tune LLM and analytics pipelines based on real-world data.
Officially launch the MVP with full stakeholder analysis and news intelligence features.
